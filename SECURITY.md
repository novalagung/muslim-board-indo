*Muslim Board Browser Extension* is an Open Source app created by Noval Agung Prayogo, provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use Muslim Board.

If you choose to use Muslim Board, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible at Muslim Board unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

### Information Collection and Use

- GeoLocation data

Muslim Board needs to collect the gelocation of user for calculating the correct prayer time. The data is temporary stored in our server for 3 days (See the following code as reference: [github.com/novalagung/muslimboard/webservice/models/constant.go](https://github.com/novalagung/muslimboard/blob/master/webservice/models/constant.go))

### Service Providers

Muslim Board needs to get the data from our backend API service, hosted in our cloud. The source code of the webservice is available under GitHub [github.com/novalagung/muslimboard/webservice](https://github.com/novalagung/muslimboard/blob/master/webservice)

### Security

We value user trust in providing us their information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
